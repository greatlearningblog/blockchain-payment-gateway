## Overview

With the rise of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain-based payment gateways are emerging as secure, transparent, and cost-effective alternatives to traditional payment methods. This project builds a simple payment gateway that allows users to send ETH payments through MetaMask. The smart contract automatically records the payment on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Cryptocurrency Payments:** Accept payments in Ethereum.
- **Smart Contract Transactions:** Automate payment processing and verification.
- **Blockchain Verification:** Transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
- **MetaMask Integration:** Users can easily send transactions using their crypto wallet.
- **Real-Time Payment Status:** Retrieve and display live contract balance and transaction events.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js & Express.js:** Server-side runtime and API framework.
- **Web3.js:** Interact with Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Solidity:** Smart contract programming language.
- **MetaMask:** Browser extension for crypto transactions.
- **(Optional) MongoDB/Firebase:** For storing transaction records (not included in this demo).

## Installation
